        <p>UF-TYPE is a student run organization at the University
        of Florida, that acts as one of the outreach programs of UF's Women in
        Computer Science and Engineering(WiCSE). Our mission is two fold:
        <b> (1) </b>Provide
        <b>education</b> to the Gainesville youth that want to learn how to write
        code.
        <b> (2) </b>Create a
        <b>community</b> of Gainesville female computer scientists. We feel that if
        a student wants to learn something, they should have access to the tools
        and curricular in order to do so. We have noticed that many schools in the
        area lack the funding to implement computer science classes, and we understand
        that computer science can be a daunting subject to learn. So, we provide
        education to the students in Gainesville that want to learn computer science
        but don’t have the tools to do so.
        <br>
        <br>Also, we believe that the lack of female interest in computer science
        stems from the fact that most girls don’t know of a single female computer
        scientist. This creates a chicken-egg problem that we solve by developing
        a community of girls in Gainesville that have an interest in computer science.
        We will do this by holding city-wide events like all-girl hackathons and
        coding workshops that will expose girls to other female computer scientists
        and bring together all of the girls interested in computer science in Gainesville.
        We hope that building this community will not only expose girls to the
        importance and power of code, but foster friendship, encouragement, and
        positivity in the girls’ lives.</p>

        <h3>Girls Who Code</h3>
        <p class="about-subtext">Girls Who Code is a national organization that is working to close the
        gender gap in computing fields, by teaching girls in middle and high school
        how to code. We felt that opening a chapter of Girls Who Code was a great
        starting point to developing a community of female coders in Gainesville.</p>

        <h3>Gainesville Coding Club</h3>
        <p class="about-subtext">
          Gainesville Coding Club is a program that we developed in order to help
          local schools teach students, irrespective of background, how to code.
          This club meets once a week for two hours after school, where University
          of Florida students hold a class using a curriculum that we developed.
          Through this program, we will also show the girls who attend the school
          that coding is a core skill of the 21st century that anyone do no matter
          their gender.
